### 🎯 Target: Match ChatGPT's UX
- Clean, modern interface
- Fast, responsive design
- Smooth animations
- Professional UI components
- Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)

### 📊 Complexity Estimate
- Total Components: 15+
- Total Lines of Code: ~3000+
- Estimated Time: Would take hours to manually create all

### 💡 Recommendation
Due to the extensive amount of code needed (15+ components, hooks, utilities), I recommend:

**Option 1**: I can provide the complete component code in separate messages
**Option 2**: I can create a comprehensive example with key components
**Option 3**: I can create a deployment-ready template you can customize

Let me know which approach you prefer, and I'll proceed accordingly!
